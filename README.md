## New Features

### Password Visibility Toggle
Users can click on the eye icon to show/hide their password, making it easier to verify what they've typed without compromising security.

### Password Matching Validation
The registration form now checks if the password and confirm password fields match, displaying an error when they don't.

### Real-time Validation
Forms provide immediate feedback when:
- Passwords don't match
- Password is too short (minimum 6 characters)
- Required fields are empty
- Email format is invalid

### Improved Error Messages
Clear, contextual error messages help users understand exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

2. Test the password visibility toggle by clicking the eye icon
3. Test form validation by intentionally entering mismatched passwords
4. Debug mode is available by adding `?debug=true` to your URL
