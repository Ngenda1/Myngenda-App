# Myngenda Authentication URL Fix Package

This package contains all the necessary files updated with the correct Replit URL to fix connection issues between Netlify and Replit.

## What's Fixed

The main issue was an incorrect Replit URL in several authentication-related files:
- Incorrect URL: `https://myngenda-app.replit.app`
- Correct URL: `https://myngenda.replit.app`

Updated files include:
1. `public/auth-connector.js` - Main authentication connector
2. `public/auth-handler.js` - Enhanced authentication handler
3. `public/netlify-auth-fix.js` - Netlify-specific authentication fix
4. `public/redirect-handler.js` - Handles redirects after authentication
5. `public/fetch-handler.js` - Enhanced fetch capabilities with authentication

## Installation Instructions

1. Download and extract this package
2. Copy all files to their corresponding locations in your GitHub repository:
   - All files in the `public` folder should go to your repository's `public` folder
3. Commit and push to GitHub to trigger a new Netlify deployment

## Testing After Deployment

1. After deployment to Netlify, visit your login page with debug mode enabled:
   `https://your-site.netlify.app/login.html?debug=true`
2. Check the browser console (F12 > Console tab) for detailed logs
3. Verify that requests are being made to the correct Replit URL

## Common Issues

If you're still having connection issues:
1. Make sure your Replit server is running
2. Check that CORS is properly configured on your Replit server
3. Verify that both the frontend and backend are using the same authentication flow
