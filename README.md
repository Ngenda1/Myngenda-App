# Myngenda Session Persistence Fix

This package fixes the issue where you get logged in for a second but then automatically logged out. The problem is that the user ID isn't being properly stored in the session.

## What's Included

1. **Enhanced Session Configuration** - Updates your session setup with:
   - Longer session duration (30 days)
   - Proper cookie settings for cross-domain usage
   - Better development vs production handling

2. **Authentication Session Fix** - Ensures user ID is properly stored in session by:
   - Intercepting login requests to properly save session data
   - Adding token verification to sync session state
   - Providing debug endpoints to verify session status

## Installation Instructions

1. Copy the files to your server code:
   - `server/session-config.ts` - Enhanced session configuration
   - `server/auth-session-fix.ts` - Authentication session persistence fix

2. Update your server's main file to use these new modules:

```typescript
// In your main server file (index.ts or similar)
import { setupEnhancedSession } from './session-config';
import { setupAuthSessionFix } from './auth-session-fix';

// Replace your existing session setup with the enhanced version
setupEnhancedSession(app);

// Add the auth session fix AFTER your authentication setup
setupAuthSessionFix(app);
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Clear your browser cookies and cache before testing
2. Try logging in with your admin credentials
3. If you still experience issues, use the debug endpoint:
   - Visit: https://myngenda.replit.app/api/auth/session-debug
   - This will show if your session is properly storing the user ID

## Don't Forget!

Make sure that you:
1. Restart your server after applying these changes
2. Properly integrate the code in your existing codebase
3. Test on both Replit and Netlify environments
