# Myngenda Authentication Fix

This package contains a complete solution to fix the authentication issues with your Myngenda application. It resolves:

1. Users failing to login after successful registration
2. Admin users getting redirected to the landing page
3. Connection and session persistence issues

## What's Included

### Server-Side Files

1. **auth-fix.ts** - Enhanced authentication routes for login and registration with proper password handling
2. **session-fix.ts** - Improved session configuration to maintain login state across tabs and page reloads
3. **storage-fix.ts** - Storage enhancements for proper password hashing and user retrieval
4. **index-integration.ts** - Example file showing how to integrate these fixes into your main server file

### Client-Side Files

1. **auth-connector.js** - Enhanced frontend authentication connector with improved error handling and persistence

## Installation Instructions

To apply this fix to your GitHub repository:

1. **Server Files**: Copy the `.ts` files from the `/server` folder to your server directory

2. **Client File**: Replace your existing `auth-connector.js` with the enhanced version

3. **Integration**: Update your main server file (`index.ts` or similar) to use these enhancements:

```typescript
// Add these imports to your server/index.ts file
import { setupSessionFix } from './session-fix';
import { setupAuthFix } from './auth-fix';
import { enhanceStorage } from './storage-fix';

// Then update your code to use them (order matters):

// 1. Set up enhanced session (early in your middleware chain)
setupSessionFix(app);

// 2. Enhance your storage with proper password handling
enhanceStorage(storage);

// 3. Set up authentication fix
setupAuthFix(app);
```

## Key Fixes

### 1. Password Handling Fix
The main issue preventing login after registration was improper password handling. This fix ensures:
- Passwords are consistently hashed during registration
- Password comparison is done correctly during login

### 2. Session Persistence Fix
To keep users logged in (especially admin users), this fix enhances session handling:
- Longer session duration (30 days)
- Proper cookie settings for cross-domain use
- Session synchronization between tabs

### 3. Client-Side Enhancement
The improved frontend connector ensures:
- Better error handling for network issues
- More reliable token and user data storage
- Automatic retry for failed requests

## Testing After Installation

After installing these fixes:

1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Register a new test user
3. Log out and log back in with the same credentials
4. Test admin login to ensure proper redirection

## Additional Notes

- This fix is compatible with your existing codebase and won't break any functionality
- No database changes are required - it works with your current schema
- The fix preserves all existing authentication routes while improving their reliability
