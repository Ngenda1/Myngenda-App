# Myngenda Authentication & Dashboard Fix

This package provides a complete solution to fix two critical issues:
1. Connection failures during registration
2. Admin users automatically being logged out

## What's Included

### Server-Side Files:
- `server/cors-fix.js` - Enables reliable connections from Netlify to Replit
- `server/session-fix.js` - Prevents automatic logout by enhancing session persistence
- `server/auth-routes-fix.js` - Improves registration and login with proper password handling
- `server/storage-fix.js` - Adds missing getUserByEmail method and enhances password handling
- `server/integration.js` - Example file showing how to integrate all fixes

### Client-Side Files:
- `public/auth-connector.js` - Enhanced frontend connector with improved error handling and retry logic

## How to Implement This Fix

### Step 1: Update Your Server Code

1. Add these files to your server directory:
   - `cors-fix.js`
   - `session-fix.js`
   - `auth-routes-fix.js`
   - `storage-fix.js`

2. In your main server file (usually `server/index.js` or `server/index.ts`), add these imports:
   ```javascript
   const { setupCors } = require('./cors-fix');
   const { setupEnhancedSession } = require('./session-fix');
   const { setupAuthRoutes } = require('./auth-routes-fix');
   const { enhanceStorage } = require('./storage-fix');
   ```

3. Apply the fixes in this order (after creating your Express app):
   ```javascript
   // First, set up CORS to fix connection issues
   setupCors(app);

   // Next, set up enhanced session to fix logout issues
   setupEnhancedSession(app);

   // Then enhance storage with proper password handling
   enhanceStorage(storage, db, users, eq);

   // Finally, set up enhanced authentication routes
   setupAuthRoutes(app, storage);
   ```

### Step 2: Update Your Frontend Code

1. Replace your existing `auth-connector.js` file with the one from this package.

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

1. Make sure all existing server processes are stopped
2. Start your server again

## What This Fix Does

### 1. Connection Issues Fix
- The CORS configuration properly allows connections from Netlify to Replit
- The auth connector implements retry logic for resilience against network issues
- Proper error handling provides clear feedback to users

### 2. Admin Logout Fix
- Enhanced session configuration with longer duration and better cookie settings
- Dual storage of user data in both localStorage and sessionStorage
- Explicit session saving in authentication routes

### 3. Registration/Login Disconnect Fix
- Proper password hashing during registration
- Consistent password comparison during login
- Added getUserByEmail method to storage

## Testing After Implementation

After implementing these fixes:
1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Try registering a new user
3. Log in with the same credentials
4. Log in as admin and verify you stay logged in

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues after implementation:
1. Add `?debug=true` to any URL to see additional debug information in the console
2. Check the server logs for any errors
