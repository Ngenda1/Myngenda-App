# Myngenda Connection Fix Package

This package contains robust solutions to fix connection issues between your Netlify frontend and Replit backend.

## What's Included

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration
- Comprehensive CORS setup that allows connections from all Netlify domains
- Support for production domains, deploy previews, and local development
- Proper handling of preflight requests

### 2. Authentication Connection Fixer
- Dual support for both session cookies and token authentication
- Debug endpoints to verify connection status
- Detailed error handling with environment-aware responses

### 3. Authentication Debug Tools
- Frontend debug panel (activated with ?debug=true in URL)
- Connection testing utilities
- Environment detection and appropriate API URL selection

## How to Install

1. Copy the server files to your Replit backend repository:
   - `server/cors-fix.ts` - Main CORS configuration
   - `server/auth-connection-fixer.ts` - Authentication connection fixer

2. Copy the public files to your frontend repository:
   - `public/auth-debug.js` - Debug tools for frontend

3. Update your server code to use these new modules:

```typescript
// In your main server file (index.ts or similar)
import { setupCors } from './cors-fix';
import { setupAuthConnection, authConnectionErrorHandler } from './auth-connection-fixer';

// Setup CORS early in your middleware chain
setupCors(app);

// Setup authentication connection fixer after your session middleware
setupAuthConnection(app);

// Add the error handler at the end of your middleware chain
app.use(authConnectionErrorHandler);
```

4. Add the debug script to your HTML pages:

```html
<!-- Add this before your other scripts -->
<script src="/auth-debug.js"></script>
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Add `?debug=true` to your URL to activate the debug panel
2. Use the debug panel to test connection to your backend
3. Check browser console for detailed logs
