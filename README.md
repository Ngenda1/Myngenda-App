# Myngenda Authentication Fix

This patch addresses the authentication issues between the Netlify frontend and the Replit backend for the Myngenda app.

## What This Fixes

1. **Authentication**: Ensures users can log in and register from the Netlify-hosted site
2. **Redirection**: Fixes the redirection to dashboard after login/registration
3. **Connection Reliability**: Improves the connection between Netlify frontend and Replit backend
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages for users when network issues occur

## How to Implement

1. Upload `auth-connector.js` to your Netlify site's root directory
2. In your Netlify site's HTML files (login.html, register.html, and all dashboard pages), replace the existing script tag:
   ```html
   <script src="/direct-auth.js"></script>
   ```
   with:
   ```html
   <script src="/auth-connector.js"></script>
   ```

3. Check that your login and registration pages redirect properly to `/user/home.html` after successful authentication

## Important Notes

- This patch maintains all existing functionality, including Google Maps integration
- It preserves any existing API keys you have configured
- The real-time tracking through WebSockets should continue to work as before
- This is a minimal change focused only on fixing the authentication issues
