# Myngenda Authentication Fix Package

This package contains fixed authentication files for the Myngenda application with the **correct Replit URL**.

## What's Fixed

1. Updated `auth-connector.js` to use the correct Replit URL: `https://myngenda.replit.app`
2. Updated `auth-handler.js` to use the correct Replit URL: `https://myngenda.replit.app`
3. Added debugging capabilities (access with `?debug=true` parameter in URL)
4. Improved error handling and connection reliability

## Installation Instructions

1. Extract this package
2. Copy the files to their corresponding locations in your GitHub repository:
   - `public/auth-connector.js` → Replace your existing auth-connector.js
   - `public/auth-handler.js` → Replace your existing auth-handler.js
3. Commit and push to GitHub to trigger a new Netlify deployment

## Testing

After deployment, visit your Netlify site with `?debug=true` added to the URL to see detailed debug information.
Example: `https://myngenda.netlify.app/login.html?debug=true`

## Important Notes

- The connection error was due to an incorrect Replit URL in the authentication files
- The correct URL is now configured: `https://myngenda.replit.app`
- Make sure your Replit server is running when testing the authentication
